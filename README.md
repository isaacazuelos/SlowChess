SlowChess
=========

A chess engine in Haskell with no great emphasis on anything.

It's still *very* early in development, so there's nothing much to see.

TODO
----

Things to fix when I have an internet connection again:

* Look up how to fix the documentation in `Game.SlowChess.Mask` for movement.
* Look into using lenses for the board representation access.
