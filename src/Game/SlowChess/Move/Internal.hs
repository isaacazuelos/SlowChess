-- | Does a ply's target move it to any of the places indicated in the mask?
-- Typically this is used with the mask as a filter for to pick out blanks or
-- enemies.

-- For example, to compute where knights might land on blanks you might do:
--
-- > do p <- each Black Knight staring)
-- >    t <- jumpKnight p
-- >    lands (blanks b) t

-- off the board.
